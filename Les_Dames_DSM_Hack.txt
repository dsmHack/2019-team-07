Dark Blue:	#0055A4

Content types setup in Contently

Any - Shows all content types setup

About - Content for the About / Get to Know Us page: http://lesdamesdsm.org/about/

Additional Page - Used to create new pages on the web site.  Review the “Sample Page (Do NOT Delete)” page as an example.  You can see the sample page at:  
http://lesdamesdsm.org/page/sample-page-do-not-delete/

After you create a new page, you refer to it by the text in the slug field.  The slug field is auto-created as you type in the title, but you can change or shorten.  The important thing is that the slug is unique to this page.  

Once the page is created, you add it as page/<slug> in Main Navigation.  For example, if the slug for a page is “good-wine”, you would add it as page/good-wine.  Review other navigation items to see how they were setup.
